- Artifical Intelligence is used go perform tasks that requires human intelligence, such as speech recognition and decision making. 

- Machine learning is part of AI which provides the system for the ability to learn from experiences in order for these 
technologies to become better


## Artificial-Intelligence in Software Testing

** Artificial-Intelligence Under Software Development **

- Although AI has been small as comapred to technolgoies, such as smart speakers or self driving cars, it is still driving foward

- Tools to test software are being made using AI are being used to make software development life cycle easier.

- It can be used to reduce the amount of tasks in development and testing.

- AI enabled bots can identify recent code changes and check current state of tests.
