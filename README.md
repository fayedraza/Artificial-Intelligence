# Artificial-Intelligence

## What is Artificial-Intelligence and Machine Learning?

- Artifical Intelligence is used go perform tasks that requires human intelligence, such as speech recognition and decision making. 

- Machine learning is part of AI which provides the system for the ability to learn from experiences in order for these 
technologies to become better.


## Artificial-Intelligence in Software Testing

**Artificial-Intelligence Under Software Development**

- Although AI has been small as comapred to technolgoies, such as smart speakers or self driving cars, it is still driving foward

- Tools to test software are being made using AI are being used to make software development life cycle easier.

- It can be used to reduce the amount of tasks in development and testing.

- AI enabled bots can identify recent code changes and check current state of tests.

## AI Techniques 

## Neural Machine Translation 

- It predicts the sequence of words.
- It uses neural machine translation. 
- It learns from experience.

# How much memory do they need?
  They only need a fraction a memory unlike statistical machine translation.
  
# How much time do they need?
  They do not need as much time as statistical machine translation.
  
# How does neural machine translation work?
 - The neural network takes an input and convert it to vectors in matrices for the computer to understand.
 - The neural network converts the number back.

# Examples of nerual machine translation

- Google translate
- Facial recognition
- Snapchat

# How does a artificial neural network apply to nerual machine translation ?

###### Model of a Artificial Neural Network

**Real World Example: Google Translate**

- A word is taken and the neural network converts it to vertices
- The vertices convert it back to the input in a different language
